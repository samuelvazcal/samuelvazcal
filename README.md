- 👋 Hi, I’m @samuelvazcal, a Mexican engineer who maybe looks like a late starter in the IT industry, but trust me. I'm a real enthusiast of the programming world
- 🤓 I have plenty of background in software development (professional, academic, and personal projects) but it's never enough and I want to learn and shared even more
- 👀 I’m interested in Java programming, algorithms, relational databases, Javascript, and now cloud computing sounds awesome for me too. Every day is a new opportunity to be a better developer.
- 🌱 Currently mastering Java 8, MySQL, Linux, and Javascript. Daily learning is always an option.
